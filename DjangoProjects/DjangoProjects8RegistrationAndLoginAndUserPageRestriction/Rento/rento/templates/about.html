          The Very Hungry Caterpillar is a children's picture book designed, illustrated, and written by Eric
          Carle, first published by the World Publishing Company in 1969, later published by Penguin
          Putnam.[1]
          The book features a caterpillar who eats his way through a wide variety of foodstuffs before
          pupating
          and emerging as a butterfly. The winner of many children's literature awards and a major graphic
          design
          award,[2] it has sold almost 50 million copies worldwide.[3] It has been described as having sold
          the
          equivalent of a copy per minute since its publication, and as "one of the greatest childhood
          classics of
          all time."[4] It was voted the number two children's picture book in a 2012 survey of School Library
          Journal readers.[5]

          The Very Hungry Caterpillar is Carle's third book, and uses distinctive collage illustrations which
          were
          innovative at the time of publication, 'eaten' holes in the pages and simple text with educational
          themes â€“ counting, the days of the week, foods, and a butterfly's life stages. It teaches children
          how
          to count and to make one-to-one correspondences between numbers and the items the hungry caterpillar
          has
          eaten. There have been many related books and other products, including educational tools, created
          in
          connection to the book. The caterpillar's diet is fictional rather than scientifically accurate, but
          the
          book introduces concepts of Lepidoptera life stages where transformations take place including the
          ultimate metamorphosis from 'hungry caterpillar' to 'handsome butterfly', and it has been endorsed
          by
          the Royal Entomological Society.
