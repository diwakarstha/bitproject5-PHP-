            The Very Hungry Caterpillar is a children's picture book designed, illustrated, and written by Eric
            Carle, first published by the World Publishing Company in 1969, later published by Penguin
            Putnam.[1]
            The book features a caterpillar who eats his way through a wide variety of foodstuffs before
            pupating
            and emerging as a butterfly. The winner of many children's literature awards and a major graphic
            design
            award,[2] it has sold almost 50 million copies worldwide.[3] It has been described as having sold
            the
            equivalent of a copy per minute since its publication, and as "one of the greatest childhood
            classics of
            all time."[4] It was voted the number two children's picture book in a 2012 survey of School Library
            Journal readers.[5]

            The Very Hungry Caterpillar is Carle's third book, and uses distinctive collage illustrations which
            were
            innovative at the time of publication, 'eaten' holes in the pages and simple text with educational
            themes â€“ counting, the days of the week, foods, and a butterfly's life stages. It teaches children
            how
            to count and to make one-to-one correspondences between numbers and the items the hungry caterpillar
            has
            eaten. There have been many related books and other products, including educational tools, created
            in
            connection to the book. The caterpillar's diet is fictional rather than scientifically accurate, but
            the
            book introduces concepts of Lepidoptera life stages where transformations take place including the
            ultimate metamorphosis from 'hungry caterpillar' to 'handsome butterfly', and it has been endorsed
            by
            the Royal Entomological Society.</p><br>
